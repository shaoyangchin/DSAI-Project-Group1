# Welcome to Happiness report analysis repository

## About
This is a mini-project for SC1015. We identified a real-life problem when it comes to measuring how happy humans are. And at a global scale with billions of people, it's difficult for governments to make informed policy decisions. First of all, it is hard to determine out of so many factors, which is the most influential one on happiness scores and human development indexes. Because of this difficulty, it is also hard to determine the amount of resources and time that should be invested into improving and designing these policies.

Hence, our project is about the dynamics of happiness, where we use datasets obtained from Kaggle and the HDR site to find another way to best predict happiness. This will be done through the data science pipeline.

## Problem Definition
To utilize machine learning models to determine which factors are most predictive of happiness scores 

Whether there is any correlation between happiness scores and the human development index

## Models Used
Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

K-Means

## Conclusion
Key Correlations: Happiness Score strongly linked with GDP, Social Support, and Healthy Life Expectancy

Model Comparison: Gradient Boosting consistently outperformed Random Forest in terms of R^2 as well as MSE, demonstrating its efficacy in error correction and learning from weaker models

Key Feature: Social Support identified as the most important feature based on Random Forest and Gradient Boosting 

## What did we learn from this project?

ML Techniques: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Means

Employed Scikit-learn for implementing algorithms such as RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor, and tools like Feature Importance and StandardScaler for data processing

Collaborating using Github

Gradient boosting was the best model and outperformed random forest in predictive accuracy
